    title: "Bags that actually make you feel good",
    time: "JULY 14, 2021",
    heading: "Here’s why I would buy these bags again and again",
    subheading:
      "I had coveted this bag for many years and the moment I took it out of the delivery box last spring, I knew this bag was well worth the wait",
    paragraphOne:
      "Over the last year I have added a number of bags to my collection. Recently, I was taking inventory of my wardrobe when I realized I've added about a dozen bags to my collection since last spring, which is a lot (even for me). I don't want to say I regret buying so many because I certainly love all of them. They each play an integral role in my wardrobe, but there are three star players that stand out. I wouldn't hesitate to purchase them again—these three bags give me those giddy, what did I do without you' and 'I can't live without you' feelings, and I highly recommend them to anyone looking to purchase a new handbag. If you want to treat yourself to a new bag, I've listed my three favorite recent purchases below. You never know, you could even end up being my bag twin!",
    paragraphTwo:
      "The first bag I cannot believe my collection went so long without is my Céline Phantom Luggage Tote. I had coveted this bag for many years and the moment I took it out of the delivery box last spring, I knew this bag was well worth the wait. It become an instant favorite of mine. Céline bags from the Phoebe Philo era have always been aspirational for me and to finally be able to own my dream bag from that time period still gives me a thrill.",
    paragraphThree:
      "My Phantom Luggage Tote is not my most functional bag by any means. It is definitely oversized and very heavy with its luxurious suede lining, but it is easily my favorite purchase from the last year (possibly ever). The bag makes such a statement and any time I carry it I feel like the most stylish person alive (even if I’m just wearing leggings on my way to a barre class). A bag that can make you feel like that is worth every single penny if you ask me! Céline (Celine?) is still selling Luggage bags on its website, but I opted to get mine on Fashionphile to get a steep discount and an original Philo era bag.",
    paragraphFour:
      "My Gucci Marmont bag is another purchase from last year that I would happily make again. Gucci Marmont bags are extremely popular among bag lovers (Megs, Kaitlin, and I all own one if that is any indication), but they’re popular for good reason. The Marmont collection has many designs, but I opted to get the small shoulder bag, which is a versatile camera bag shape. I have been vocal of my love for big bags, so I was unsure of how much use I would get out of a smaller crossbody bag. I have been shocked and delighted by how much wear I get out of this little Gucci bag!",
    paragraphFive:
      "It is big enough to fit all of my essentials, is incredibly functional and it's also easy to wear. The leather is durable as well, which is really important for me when spending so much on a bag. I wore this Gucci camera bag to bars, restaurants, sightseeing abroad, and to countless baseball games last year and it doesn’t have a scratch or scuff on it (quite impressive, honestly). Snag my exact bag for $1,290 via Gucci, or check out the latest pastel additions to the Gucci Marmont line.",
    paragraphSix:
      "The third and final bag I would not hesitate to purchase again is my Louis Vuitton Onthego. This Louis Vuitton bag is polarizing in the handbag community, as I find most people either fiercely love or hate this bag. Obviously, I am in the camp of those who love it and I am happy that I was able to add it to my collection. I went on a wild goose chase last summer trying to track down this bag and I even considered paying double the retail price for one (thank you to those of you who talked me off that ledge).",
    paragraphSeven:
      "My journey to obtaining an Onthego was a long one, after missing out on the limited edition khaki color version and trying unsuccessfully to track one down in Paris last summer. I finally found an Onthego in a Louis Vuitton boutique this past winter and quickly scooped it up and brought it home. I must admit that the khaki color Onthego is “the one that got away”, but I still am quite pleased with my reverse monogram version. Louis Vuitton recently released this style in different sizes and materials, and I could easily see myself adding a leather version of the Onthego bag to my collection in the near future.",

    subheading:
      "Designers have chosen to dip into brand archives for inspiration, thus reviving both designs in their entirety as well as specific elements from the past.",
    paragraphOne:
      "The last few years have seen a resurgence in archival designs from major design houses. Designers have chosen to dip into brand archives for inspiration, thus reviving both designs in their entirety as well as specific elements from the past. Alessandro Michele has taken the latter route with the introduction of Gucci's new 1955 Horsebit collection. The first bag from the Horsebit line was introduced last fall and since then the line has been expanded to include bucket bags, and more recently totes and top handle shapes too. While the silhouettes and designs are original creations by Michele himself, the storytelling behind these bags is rooted in the concept of neoclassicism, which focuses on revitalizing the past. Michele's 1955 Horsebit bags do just that, emblazoned with Gucci's storied Horsebit hardware, but in a fresh, modern way. ",
    paragraphTwo:
      "The Horsebit is a house icon that dates back to the 50s as its name states. The 1950s were a big decade for the house of Gucci. In 1951 Rodolfo Gucci, son of the house's founder Guccio Gucci, opened the first Gucci store in Milan. It was around the same time that the house's classic green-red-green web became synonymous with the brand. Two years later in 1953, the first American store opened on East 58th street in New York City.",
    paragraphThree:
      "That same year saw the creation of the, now iconic, Horsebit. The Horsebit's creation was based on details borrowed from the equestrian world. It joins two elements, a double ring and a bar, to create an instantly recognizable house code, which has since become a signature part of Gucci's brand DNA. Though this detail has been reinvented with the introduction of the new Horsebit line, it was actually originally seen on a pair of loafers in 1953. Two years later, in 1955, the hardware was used on a handbag for the first time.",
